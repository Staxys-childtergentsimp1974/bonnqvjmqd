OMG, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Kesari Chapter 2 and my brain is like... what even was that? You ever 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 something and feel like you were on a mental roller coaster? That's me right now. It’s like they had all these pieces of an epic story, but then just threw them up in the air and hoped for the best. 

Dude, the way they tried to connect the dots between the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and everything else was wild. I mean, respect for trying to dive deep, but talk about losing the plot. And can we talk about the action scenes? It's like they threw in explosions just cuz they could. Sometimes I'm here for that, but, seriously, it's like, can we get some substance?

> Speaking of which, the dialogue. Actual facepalm material. I'm no historian, but I’m 99.999% sure people didn’t talk like that back then. Bro, have you ever had a   line make you cringe so hard you pull a muscle? Cuz same.

Kinda made me wish I had just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   instead, at least that way I could fast-forward through the nonsense. On the bright side, the visuals were insane—the colors were popping and some of the scenes were so over-the-top it was kinda epic. 

Oh, remember that scene with the lone guy standing against a thousand? Classic cinema. Makes you wonder if they borrowed a page from every War Epic™ ever made. Oh, and the music! So intense. Maybe too intense? It’s like, calm down a little, y’know?

Honestly, a part of me was like Can't believe I actually sat down to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , but the other half kinda enjoyed the ride. I guess when you throw history, drama, and a bit of Bollywood pizzazz in a blender, you should expect a wild mix. At least it kept me awake, haha.

int confusion = epicScenes + overActing - logic;

Anyway, I'm just rambling now. It's late, and I need something normal to cleanse my brain, maybe some cat videos or just sleep. How’s your night going, by the way?
